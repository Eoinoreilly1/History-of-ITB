   <h2> ITB 1999</h2>
	<p>Set up in 1999 the first ever day attended by students was a mere rushed mess, cement was still dry in the A block, in setpember when they first opened doors</p>	<br>
					<p>it was questioned wether or not the college should be set up in the centre of blanchardstown or navan, but ever since the decision there has been shuttle busses set up to fix the transport issues from 1999 to even know in 2018</p>
<h2> 2000</h2>
	   <p> In 2000 the first ad campaigns occured for ITB, these were only broadcast on radio as it wasnt untill 2006 when digitilization hit ITB.<br></p>
					<p>At this time the logo used was red and green which was horrendous for UX and for branding due to colorblind issues.</p><br>
					<h2>2003</h2>
					<p> moving onto 2003 ITB built the link building. They invested &euro;75 million for this as now ITB was settled.<br></p>
						<p>The newest Dublin technological college was set up in Blanchardstown. This was because international companies set up in the surrounding area.
